# WinFormsExt

This is some code I was using in two different projects. It's a very small package, currently with only some [extension methods](https://github.com/adamosoftware/WinFormsExt/blob/master/WinFormsExt/TreeViewExtensions.cs) for the TreeView control. But I couldn't bear to have two copies in use, so I consolidated into this project. Since Nuget and GitHub have become my preferred way of code sharing, here we are. Install via Nuget package **AoWinFormsExt**.
